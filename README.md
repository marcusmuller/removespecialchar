# Bulk Special Character Removal Script for Files and Folders

This is a Python script that allows you to remove special characters automatically from files and folders in a specified root directory. The script recursively traverses all folders and files in the specified directory, replacing the special characters with a version without them. It provides an efficient solution for bulk renaming of files and folders by removing special characters such as emojis, symbols, or any other unwanted special characters.

## Features:

- Removes special characters from file and folder names.
- Supports removal of multiple user-defined special characters.
- Works with all file extensions and folder types.
- Handles directories recursively, including subfolders and their contents.
- Avoids naming conflicts by checking if the new name already exists before renaming.

## Usage Instructions:

1. Set the root directory where the files and folders are located.
2. Customize the list of special characters to be removed as needed.
3. Execute the script and observe how the special characters are removed in bulk.

## Notes:

- Ensure you have sufficient permissions to rename files and folders in the specified directory.
- Make a backup of the files and folders before running the script to avoid data loss.

Enjoy this useful tool for simplifying and standardizing file and folder names by quickly and efficiently removing special characters!
